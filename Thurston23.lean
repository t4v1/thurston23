# Thurston's Question 23: rational relations among hyperbolic volumes

Definition bundle and statements for a Prove2Me mission.

Thurston's twenty-third question, from *Three-dimensional manifolds, Kleinian
groups and hyperbolic geometry*, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. **6** (1982), 357--381,
reads on p. 380: "Show that volumes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds are not all
rationally related." Some rational relations are forced: a degree `n` cover has
`n` times the volume, so commensurable manifolds always have rationally related
volumes. The question is whether those are the only ones, that is whether some
two volumes have irrational ratio. (The paraphrase "are the volumes rationally
independent?", found in secondary sources, is not Thurston's wording; read
literally it is false for the reason just given.)

The bundle below fixes the meaning of every word in that sentence. Hyperbolic
`3`-space is the upper half-space; its volume is Lebesgue measure with density
`z⁻³`, which is the Riemannian volume of the hyperbolic metric written out, so
no Riemannian machinery is needed; the hyperbolic distance is given by its
closed formula; a Kleinian action is a free, properly discontinuous action by
hyperbolic isometries; and the volume of the quotient is the measure of a
fundamental domain in the sense of `MeasureTheory.IsFundamentalDomain`.

Isometries are not required to preserve orientation, so the set of volumes
below contains the volumes of non-orientable quotients as well; this enlarges
the set but not its `ℚ`-span, and both goals below are unaffected. That
isometries preserve the hyperbolic volume is a field of the structure rather
than a derived fact: deriving it amounts to classifying the isometry group of
`ℍ³`, which is not the subject of this mission.

Two milestones are stated: that passing to a subgroup of index `n` multiplies
the volume by `n`, which is the source of every known rational relation between
volumes, and that the set of volumes is nonempty, without which the goal would
be vacuous. Milestone 1 is proved below, from a general fact about fundamental
domains of a finite-index subgroup that Mathlib does not have. Two sanity
checks pin down the hand-written definitions: `hvol` gives a cusp box its
expected volume, and `hdist` restricts to Mathlib's metric on the upper
half-plane. The positive half of
Thurston's framing is also proved: commensurable subgroups of a Kleinian group
have rationally related volumes.

Milestone 2 is proved as well. `SL(2, ℂ)` acts on `ℍ³` by Möbius transformations
through the quaternions, by isometries of `hdist` that preserve `hvol`; the
Picard group `SL(2, ℤ[i])` inside it acts properly discontinuously, and its
congruence subgroup `Γ(2 + i)` has finite index and acts freely, so it is a
Kleinian group. A free, properly discontinuous action has a measurable
fundamental domain, of volume at most that of any set meeting every orbit;
reduction theory for the Picard group supplies such a set of finite volume, and
`hvol ≠ 0` makes the volume positive. The goal is left open.

of `hvol` is stated as a field: it is true of every hyperbolic isometry, but

/-! ## Supporting material for Milestone 1

Mathlib relates the measures of two fundamental domains of the *same* action but
has nothing relating a group to a finite-index subgroup, so that is developed
here. `measure_eq_index_smul` is the general measure-theoretic statement;
`countable_of_properlyDiscontinuous` supplies the countability of the acting
group that Mathlib's fundamental-domain API requires throughout, and which for a
Kleinian group is a consequence of proper discontinuity rather than a hypothesis.

/-! ## A sanity check on `hvol`

`hvol` is built with `Measure.comap`, which returns the zero measure when its
measurability side conditions fail — silently, with every theorem about it
still type-checking. Nothing else in the bundle evaluates `hvol` on a concrete
set, so one value is computed here: the unit cusp box `[0,1]² × [1,∞)` has
hyperbolic volume `∫₀¹∫₀¹∫₁^∞ t⁻³ = 1/2`. Consequently `hvol ≠ 0`. -/

`hdist` is written out by hand, so it is checked against the one reviewed
hyperbolic metric Mathlib has: on the vertical slice `y = 0`, which is a copy of

`cosh` equal to `1 + |z - w|² / (2 Im z Im w)` (Mathlib's `cosh_dist`), and the

/-! ## Commensurable groups have rationally related volumes

The positive half of Thurston's framing, stated exactly. If `Γ₁` and `Γ₂` are
subgroups of one Kleinian group and are commensurable — Mathlib's definition is
that `Γ₁ ⊓ Γ₂` has finite index in both — then Milestone 1 applied twice to the
same fundamental domain for the intersection gives
`[Γ₁ : Γ₁ ⊓ Γ₂] · vol Γ₁ = vol (Γ₁ ⊓ Γ₂) = [Γ₂ : Γ₁ ⊓ Γ₂] · vol Γ₂`, so the ratio of
the volumes is rational. Every known rational relation between volumes of
hyperbolic `3`-manifolds arises this way. The converse is false: Ruberman's
mutation preserves volume and typically destroys commensurability.

The general statement is proved for any countable group acting on any measure
space with an invariant measure, as Milestone 1 was, and then specialised. -/

/-! ## Toward Milestone 2: the Möbius action of `SL(2, ℂ)`

Milestone 2 needs a lattice, and every lattice comes from `PSL(2, ℂ)`. This section
gives `ℍ³` its action by `SL(2, ℂ)`: the point `(x, y, t)` is the quaternion
`x + y i + t j`, and `g = !![a, b; c, d]` acts by `q ↦ (a q + b)(c q + d)⁻¹`. Nothing
here is hyperbolic geometry yet — isometry and volume preservation are the next
sub-problems — but the action is what everything after it is stated about. -/

/-- Mathlib's `Star ℍ[R]` instance is stated with the `Zero`, `One`, `Neg` arguments of
`Quaternion R` derived from `[CommRing R]`, while `ℍ` elaborates them directly; instance
search cannot unify the two while the ring instance is still a metavariable, so `star`
fails to elaborate on `ℍ` in a fresh file. This is Mathlib's instance, restated. -/
instance instStarH : Star ℍ := Quaternion.instStar

/-! The point `(x, y, t)` of the upper half-space is the quaternion `x + y i + t j`, and
`g = !![a, b; c, d]` acts by `q ↦ (a q + b)(c q + d)⁻¹`, with the complex entries
embedded in the quaternions. The image has `k`-part `t · Im(det g)` and `j`-part
`t · Re(det g)` before normalising, so `det g = 1` is exactly what keeps the action
inside the half-space. The composition law is division-ring algebra: the complex
entries sit to the left of `q` and commute among themselves. -/

/-! ## Toward Milestone 2: the action is by isometries

`hdist` is `arcosh` of `1 + |p − q|² / (2 p₃ q₃)`. Under `g` the height `p₃` is divided by
`D_p = |c p + d|²`, and the squared distance `|p − q|²` is divided by `D_p D_q`, so the
quotient is unchanged. The second fact is the two-sided factorisation
`(p c + d)(g p − g q)(c q + d) = p − q` in the quaternions — `c` to the right of `p` on the
left factor — which needs only that the complex entries commute among themselves and
that `ad − bc = 1`; taking norms, nothing is ever inverted. -/

/-! ## Toward Milestone 2: the action preserves the volume

`hvol` is Lebesgue measure with density `ρ(x) = t⁻³` on the half-space `U ⊆ ℝ³`. A map
`Φ : ℝ³ → ℝ³` that is differentiable and injective on `U` transports `hvol` to itself
exactly when `|det Φ'(x)| · ρ(Φ x) = ρ(x)` on `U`; that is Mathlib's change of variables
formula. `SL(2, ℂ)` is generated by three families with explicit coordinate formulas —
translations `T b`, the linear maps `D a`, and the inversion `S` — and measure
preservation composes, so each family is handled once and the rest is the Bruhat
factorisation `g = T(a/c) · S · D(c) · T(d/c)`. Preimages under `g` are images under
`g⁻¹`, so only images are ever computed. -/

/-! ## Toward Milestone 2: the Picard group acts properly discontinuously

The Picard group `SL(2, ℤ[i])` sits in `SL(2, ℂ)` as the matrices with Gaussian integer
entries. A compact subset of `ℍ³` lies in a box: heights in `[t₀, T]` with `t₀ > 0`, and
`|q|² ≤ R`. If `g` moves a point `q` of the box to a point of the box, the heights give
`|c q + d|² = t / t' ≤ T / t₀`; since `|c q + d|² ≥ |c|² t²` this bounds `c`, and then `d`.
The same argument for `g⁻¹ = !![d, -b; -c, a]`, which moves `g q` back to `q`, bounds `a`,
and `b = (g q)(c q + d) − a q` is bounded by the rest. Only finitely many Gaussian integers
lie in a disc. -/

/-! ## Toward Milestone 2: a torsion-free subgroup of finite index

The principal congruence subgroup `Γ(2 + i)`: the matrices of `SL(2, ℤ[i])` congruent to the
identity modulo the prime `2 + i`, of norm `5`. It has finite index, being the kernel of
reduction to the finite group `SL(2, ℤ[i]/(2 + i))`, and it acts freely. At a fixed point
`q = z + t j` of `g`, the `j` and `k` parts of `q (c q + d) = a q + b` give
`a = 2 Re(c z) + conj d`, so `tr g = 2 Re(c z + d)` is real, and the heights give
`|c q + d| = 1`, so `|tr g| ≤ 2`. For `g ∈ Γ(2 + i)` the trace is a Gaussian integer congruent
to `2`, and the only one in `[-2, 2]` is `2` itself; a fixed point with trace `2` forces `c = 0`,
`a = d = 1` and `b = 0`. (So `-I`, of trace `-2`, is not in `Γ(2 + i)` either.) With M2.2–M2.4
this makes `Γ(2 + i)` a Kleinian group. -/

/-! ## Toward Milestone 2: a fundamental domain of finite positive volume

No explicit fundamental domain is needed. A free, properly discontinuous action by
homeomorphisms of a second countable space has a measurable fundamental domain: cover the space
by countably many open sets `U n` that no nontrivial element maps into themselves, and keep a
point of `U n` when its orbit misses every earlier `U m`. Its volume is at most that of any set
meeting every orbit. For `Γ(2 + i)` such a set is a finite union of translates of the reduction
box `|x|, |y| ≤ ½`, `|q| ≥ 1` of the Picard group — finite because `Γ(2 + i)` has finite index —
and the box has finite volume, since it sits above height `½`. Positivity is `hvol ≠ 0`. -/

/-- **Milestone 2.** There is at least one finite-volume hyperbolic
`3`-manifold, so the set of volumes is nonempty. Without this the goal below
would be vacuously false rather than open. This is not a warm-up: it asks for a
concrete cofinite-volume Kleinian group together with a fundamental domain of
finite positive measure, and Mathlib has no `ℍ³`, no `Isom(ℍ³)` and no action of
`PSL(2,ℂ)` on the upper half-space.

Proved with the congruence subgroup `Γ(2 + i)` of the Picard group: it is Kleinian
(`isKleinian_gammaTwoI`) and has a fundamental domain of finite positive volume
(`exists_fundamentalDomain_gammaTwoI`). -/

/-- **Thurston's Question 23.** The volumes of hyperbolic `3`-manifolds are not
all rationally related: some two of them have irrational ratio.

This is Thurston's own wording (1982, p. 380). Rational relations do exist: a
degree `n` cover has `n` times the volume (Milestone 1), so the question is
whether every rational relation arises that way. It is not known how to exhibit
a single pair of hyperbolic `3`-manifolds whose volumes have irrational ratio.
For arithmetic examples Humbert's formula expresses the volume of the Bianchi
quotient of an imaginary quadratic field `F` as `|δ_F|^{3/2} ζ_F(2) / 4π²`, so
the question reduces to the irrationality of a ratio of Dedekind zeta values at
`2`, a transcendence statement of the same difficulty as the irrationality of
`ζ(5)`. -/
